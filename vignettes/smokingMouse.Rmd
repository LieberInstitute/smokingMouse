# Welcome

Welcome to the `smokingMouse` project.
In this vignette we'll show you how to access the smokingMouse LIBD datasets `r Citep(bib[['smokingMouse']])`.
You can find the analysis code and the data generation in [here](https://github.com/LieberInstitute/smokingMouse_Indirects).

## Overview
This project consisted of a differential expression analysis (DEA) involving 4 data types: genes, exons, transcripts and junctions. 
The main goal of this study was to explore the effects of smoking and nicotine exposures on the developing brain of mice pups. 
As secondary objectives, this work evaluated the affected genes by each substance on adult brain in order to compare pup and adult results, and the effects of smoking on adult blood and brain to search for overlapping biomarkers in both tissues. 
Finally, mice DEG were compared against results of a previous study on human to see how consistent the results were.

The next table summarizes the analyses done at each level.

## Study design
36 pregnant mice and 35 not pregnant female adults were administered nicotine (n=12), exposed to cigarette smoke (n=24) or controls (n=35) and RNA sequencing experiments were performed on frontal cortices of all the resultant 137 P0 pups and on frontal cortices (n=47) or blood (n=24) of the 71 adults, totaling 208 samples. 
Of the total pup samples, 19 were born to mice that were administered nicotine, 46 to mice exposed to smoking and the remaining 72 to control mice.

# Basics

## Install `smokingMouse`

`R` is an open-source statistical environment which can be easily modified to enhance its functionality via packages.
`r Biocpkg("smokingMouse")` is a `R` package available via the [Bioconductor](http://bioconductor.org) repository for packages. 
`R` can be installed on any operating system from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/) after which you can install `r Biocpkg("smokingMouse")` by using the following commands in your `R` session:

```{r "install", eval = FALSE}
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE)) {
    install.packages("BiocManager")
}

BiocManager::install("smokingMouse")

## Check that you have a valid Bioconductor installation
BiocManager::valid()
```

## Required knowledge

`r Biocpkg("smokingMouse")` is based on many other packages and in particular in those that have implemented the infrastructure needed for dealing with RNA-seq data and differential expression. 
That is, packages like `r Biocpkg("SummarizedExperiment")` and `r Biocpkg("limma")`.

If you are asking yourself the question "Where do I start using Bioconductor?" you might be interested in [this blog post](http://lcolladotor.github.io/2014/10/16/startbioc/#.VkOKbq6rRuU).

## Asking for help

As package developers, we try to explain clearly how to use our packages and in which order to use the functions. But `R` and `Bioconductor` have a steep learning curve so it is critical to learn where to ask for help. 
The blog post quoted above mentions some but we would like to highlight the [Bioconductor support site](https://support.bioconductor.org/) as the main resource for getting help: remember to use the `smokingMouse` tag and check [the older posts](https://support.bioconductor.org/tag/smokingMouse/). 
Other alternatives are available such as creating GitHub issues and tweeting. However, please note that if you want to receive help you should adhere to the [posting guidelines](http://www.bioconductor.org/help/support/posting-guide/). 
It is particularly critical that you provide a small reproducible example and your session information so package developers can track down the source of the error.

## Citing `smokingMouse`

We hope that `r Biocpkg("smokingMouse")` will be useful for your research. Please use the following information to cite the package and the overall approach.

```{r "citation"}
## Citation info
citation("smokingMouse")
```


# Quick start to using `smokingMouse`

# smoking Mouse datasets

The raw data was generated by LIBD researchers and is composed of expression counts of genes, transcripts (txs), exons and exon-exon junctions (jxns) across 208 mice samples (brain/blood; adult/pup; nicotine-exposed/smoking-exposed/controls). 
The datasets available in `r Biocpkg("smokingMouse")` were generated by Daianna Gonzalez-Padilla. 
The human data was generated by Semick SA et al. (2018) in Mol Psychiatry, DOI: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41380-018-0223-1 and it contains the results of a DEA in adult and prenatal human brain samples exposed to cigarette smoke. 

## Description of the datasets

### Mouse datasets: 
* They are 4 `r Biocpkg('RangedSummarizedExperiment')` (RSE) objects that contain feature info in `rowData(RSE)` and sample info in `colData(RSE)`. 
* Raw expression counts can be accessed with `assays(RSE)$counts` and the lognorm counts (log2(cpm + 0.5) for genes, exons and jxns; log2(tpm + 0.5) for txs) with `assays(RSE)$logcounts`.

### Human datasets:
* They are two data frames with the information of human genes and some relevant statistical metrics of differential expression (DE).

## Data specifics 

* *'rse_gene_mouse_RNAseq_nic-smo.Rdata'*: (rse_gene object) the gene RSE object contains raw and normalized expression data of 55401 mouse genes across 208 samples from brains and blood of healthy and nicotine/smoking-exposed pup and adult mice. 
* *'rse_tx_mouse_RNAseq_nic-smo.Rdata'*: (rse_tx object) the tx RSE object contains raw and normalized expression data of 142604 mouse transcripts across 208 samples from brains and blood of healthy and nicotine/smoking-exposed pup and adult mice. 
* *'rse_exon_mouse_RNAseq_nic-smo.Rdata'*: (rse_exon object) the exon RSE object contains raw and normalized expression data of 447670 mouse exons across 208 samples from brains and blood of healthy and nicotine/smoking-exposed pup and adult mice. 
* *'rse_jx_mouse_RNAseq_nic-smo.Rdata'*: (rse_jx object) the jx RSE object contains raw and normalized expression data of 1436068 mouse exon-exon junctions across 208 samples from brains and blood of healthy and nicotine/smoking-exposed pup and adult mice. 

All the above datasets contain sample and feature information and additional data of the results obtained in the filtering steps and the DEA.

* *'de_genes_prenatal_human_brain_smoking.Rdata'*: (object with the same name) data frame with DE (ctrls vs smoking-exposed samples) data of 18067 genes in human prenatal brain samples exposed to cigarette smoke.
* *'de_genes_adult_human_brain_smoking.Rdata'*: (object with the same name) data frame with DE (ctrls vs smoking-exposed samples) data of 18067 genes in human adult brain samples exposed to cigarette smoke.

## Variables of mice data

Feature information in `rowData(RSE)` contains the following variables:

* `retained_after_feature_filtering`: Boolean variable that equals TRUE if the feature passed the feature filtering based on expression levels and FALSE if not. Check code in [here](https://github.com/LieberInstitute/smokingMouse_Indirects/blob/main/code/02_build_objects/02_build_objects.R).
* `DE_in_adult_brain_nicotine`: Boolean variable that equals TRUE if the feature is differentially expressed (DE) in adult brain samples exposed to nicotine and FALSE if not. Check code in [here](https://github.com/LieberInstitute/smokingMouse_Indirects/tree/main/code/04_DEA).
* `DE_in_adult_brain_smoking`: Boolean variable that equals TRUE if the feature is differentially expressed (DE) in adult brain samples exposed to cigarette smoke and FALSE if not. Check code in [here](https://github.com/LieberInstitute/smokingMouse_Indirects/tree/main/code/04_DEA).
* `DE_in_adult_blood_smoking`: Boolean variable that equals TRUE if the feature is differentially expressed (DE) in adult blood samples exposed to cigarette smoke and FALSE if not. Check code in [here](https://github.com/LieberInstitute/smokingMouse_Indirects/tree/main/code/04_DEA).
* `DE_in_pup_brain_nicotine`: Boolean variable that equals TRUE if the feature is differentially expressed (DE) in pup brain samples exposed to nicotine and FALSE if not. Check code in [here](https://github.com/LieberInstitute/smokingMouse_Indirects/tree/main/code/04_DEA).
* `DE_in_pup_brain_smoking`: Boolean variable that equals TRUE if the feature is differentially expressed (DE) in pup brain samples exposed to cigarette smoke and FALSE if not. Check code in [here](https://github.com/LieberInstitute/smokingMouse_Indirects/tree/main/code/04_DEA).
The rest of the variables are outputs of SPEAQeasy pipeline. See [here](http://research.libd.org/SPEAQeasy/outputs.html) for a description of them. 

Sample information in `colData(RSE)` contains the following variables:

* The Quality Control (QC) variables `sum`,`detected`,`subsets_Mito_sum`, `subsets_Mito_detected`, `subsets_Mito_percent`, `subsets_Ribo_sum`,`subsets_Ribo_detected` and `subsets_Ribo_percent` are returned by `addPerCellQC()`. See [here](https://rdrr.io/bioc/scuttle/man/addPerCellQC.html) for more info.
* `retained_after_QC_sample_filtering`: Boolean variable that equals TRUE if the sample passed the sample filtering based on QC metrics and FALSE if not. Check code in [here](https://github.com/LieberInstitute/smokingMouse_Indirects/blob/main/code/03_EDA/02_QC.R).
* `retained_after_manual_sample_filtering`: Boolean variable that equals TRUE if the sample passed the manual sample filtering based on PCA plots and FALSE if not. Check code in [here](https://github.com/LieberInstitute/smokingMouse_Indirects/blob/main/code/03_EDA/03_PCA_MDS.R)
The rest of the variables are outputs of SPEAQeasy. See [here](http://research.libd.org/SPEAQeasy/outputs.html) for their description.
